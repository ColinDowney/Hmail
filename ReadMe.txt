“暗号”为需要收取的邮件标题中必须要包含的字符。
邮件标题中的“暗号”之后的字符作为子文件夹的文件名。
（例：暗号为1999，则收取邮件名为①199903、②199904的邮件，
邮件①存于文件夹“03”中，邮件②存于文件夹“04”中）。

邮箱需要开启Pop3,SMTP服务，邮箱密码填写授权码。（目前仅支持网易邮箱）

For the begining, you need to set the storage path, email and reply-mail in Settings.
The "cipher" is the string that must be included in the subject of the email to be received.
The substring after the "cipher" in the subject is the filename of the subfolder.
(example: cipher is 1999, then receive mails' subject as (1) 199903, (2) 199904,
Mail (1) is stored in the subfolder "03", mail (2) is stored in the subfolder "04").
Pop3 and SMTP service should be available of your email, and the authorization code should be filled as the email password.
(currently only netease mailbox is supported)
